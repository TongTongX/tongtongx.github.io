About me
======
I am a PhD student at Mila and Polytechnique Montréal, supervised by Prof. [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/). I completed my masters study at the University of Alberta, where I was supervised by Prof. [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/). Previously I interned at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab with [Yangchen Pan](https://yannickycpan.github.io/yangchenpan/). I also interned at Deepmind Montréal with [Daniel Toyama](https://github.com/kenjitoyama).

My research interests span reinforcement learning, multi-agent systems, and foundation models. I am particularly interested in developing autonomous agents that can efficiently coordinate with other agents to accomplish complex tasks.
